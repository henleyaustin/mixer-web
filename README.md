# Volume Mixer Web App

This app allows you to control the volume of programs running on your Windows PC from any device in your home. It's a fun project I built to gain experience and solve a small issue of laziness – I didn't want to press the Windows key and exit my app just to adjust volumes. Now, I can do it from my phone, tablet, or any device connected to my network.

## Features

- **Select Programs**: Choose which programs you want to control and adjust their volume levels.
- **Multi-Device Access**: Control the volume from any device in your home, whether it’s your phone, tablet, or another computer.
- **Demo Mode**: Want to give the app a try before using it for real? Check out the demo mode to experience how it works.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.
4. Use the npm script `npm run start-open` to start the app on your local network.
5. Make sure the backend is running on your Windows PC (see backend setup instructions).
6. Update the IP address on the _ip_ screen to match your PC’s IP.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Angular
- **Backend**: [[Link to Backend Repo](https://github.com/henleyaustin/mixer-api)]

## Demo

Try out the app in demo mode to see how it works without needing to connect to a real backend.
